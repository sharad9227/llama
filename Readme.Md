Let's walk through a high-level overview of the steps involved:

Setup Environment: Ensure you have the necessary libraries and dependencies installed, including langchain, transformers, and datasets.

Prepare Data: Load and preprocess your CSV file containing symptoms and solutions.

Define Data Loaders: Use LangChain to define data loaders for your training and evaluation datasets.

Model Configuration: Configure and initialize the LLaMA model.

Training Loop: Set up the training loop to fine-tune the LLaMA model on your data.

Evaluation and Validation: Evaluate the modelâ€™s performance on the test dataset.
